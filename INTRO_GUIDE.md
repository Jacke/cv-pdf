## “Show, don’t tell”
"Show, don't tell" is a writing technique that emphasizes the importance of
using specific details and examples to illustrate a point rather than
simply stating it. In the context of job interviews, this means providing
specific and memorable details about yourself and your experiences to help
you stand out to potential employers, rather than simply stating generic
statements about your skills or interests. By sharing personal stories and
specific examples, you can demonstrate your authenticity and passion, and
make a stronger impression on your interviewer.

### “Show, don’t tell” explanation
1. Sprinkle in specific details Imagine two responses to the stock
interview question “Tell me about yourself.” First: I started programming
about two years ago with some personal projects. I eventually got a job at
a small tech company in my home town, and I’ve been working there about a
year and a half. I like my job, but I’m looking for a new challenge, which
I think your company could provide. Then: I got started programming because
I wanted to build a social network for cats. That didn’t take off, but the
prototype helped me get a job at a small tech company in my home town. Last
month, I read an awesome article on Hacker News about the social network
your company is building. The scaling challenges you face seem like they’ll
help me grow faster and stronger than my current role will. The second
response says a lot more about the candidate. Why? Because of the specific
details. An interviewer won’t remember the tenth person to say “I’m looking
for a new challenge.” They will remember the person who tried to build a
social network for cats and read about their company on Hacker News. So
don’t skimp on the details. Look out for opportunities to use specifics,
especially if they’re at all quirky, funny, surprising, or otherwise
memorable.
Tell a story from your life
Take another common question: “Why do you
want to work here?” People tend to just cross-reference their values with
those of the company or team they’re interviewing with: I’m really
interested in technical blogging and open source. So I like that your
company has some open-source work and contributes back to the community.
That’s a fine response. But to really wow your interviewer, try adding a
specific story around those values: A couple years ago, when I was still
new to programming, I was working on this tricky bug. I found a post on a
company blog where an engineer explained how her team solved the issue. She
included a code snippet she’d open-sourced. I appreciated that she took the
time to write about her team’s experience and share their solution. It
helped me! That’s how I first started getting into open source. I really
wanna work with more engineers like that—who write about their work and try
to help others in the community. So I was excited to see all the stuff your
team shares on your blog and on the company’s Github profile. The second
response just sounds more genuine. It shows a personal connection to open
source and technical blogging, instead of just telling it. Anyone can look
up a company’s core values and repeat them during an interview. It’s more
meaningful to tell a story from your life that shows how those values
benefited you or taught you something.

### STARS Technique
Situation:
  Describe the situation that you were in when you needed to accomplish. It can be from your current job, previous job or
  from any relevant experience such as volunteer work or college clubs
Task:
  What goal were you working toward? Describe the challenge and what needs to be done to get a positive output?
Action:
  Elaborate the measures you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail. Describe the precise
  steps you took and the contribution. Talk about yourself rather than the team.
Result:
  Describe the outcome of your actions in a quantifiable way. Communicate multiple positive results.
  If the answers have a negative outcome, they should highlight your resilience or adaptability.

### Use someone else’s voice
This one’s a neat trick. Consider one more standard behavioral question: “What’s your biggest strength?”
You might tell the interviewer:
I work well with others. Even under tough circumstances, I make sure my coworkers feel supported.
But a lightly detailed story is better suited to show this strength:
I have a coworker, Ana, who’s been an engineer for almost a decade. We worked together on this really tough, messy project.
Towards the end, she told me, “For such a hellish project, you really made things feel sane.”
I think this is my biggest strength—I work well with others, even under tough circumstances.
When you respond with a story, you can refer to what other people have said about your best qualities.
In this case, a ten-year tech veteran said you made a project feel less awful. That kind of praise is a lot more
credible when it comes from someone else.
Practice, practice, practice
Remember these specific tricks for showing rather than telling:
Use specific, memorable details. “Social network for cats” instead of “a personal project.”
Tell a story from your life. “I was trying to solve a tricky bug…” instead of “I value open source contributions.”
Use someone else’s voice. “’You really made things feel sane‘” instead of "I work well with others."
Try these tactics out on the questions below. Keep in mind, sometimes it’s easiest to start
with a “tell” response, then spruce it up to “show.”
Tell me your biggest weakness as an engineer.
Describe a tricky bug you’ve encountered.
What’s the biggest project you’ve shipped?
What’s your favorite programming language? Why?
How do you overcome interpersonal conflicts with coworkers?
