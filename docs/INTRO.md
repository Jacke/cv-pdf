# Personal INTRO

## Structure
### Work history
Hi, I'm Stan - a senior software developer with extensive experience in scaling,
mentoring, and streamlining projects.

### Previously
As a senior software engineer, I have a proven track record of successfully developing and
launching complex projects.

In my previous job, I led the development of a platform for
eSport from scratch, which achieved 250 daily active users and fully complied with New
Jersey gambling regulation department requirements.

Additionally, I took on the
challenging task of reverse engineering Telegram, resulting in a successful project that
was compatible with official Telegram clients and secured initial funding from a Middle
Eastern company.

I have also launched two startups in the past. The first was a workflow
management platform that utilized early version AI to optimize daily routines. Although I
successfully developed the product and secured some customers, the market proved to be too
small and I decided to shut it down.

The second startup was a SaaS platform that enabled people to get their business incorporated and bank account set up online. 
With my efforts, the platform achieved 500 daily users and helped a total of 70,000 businesses get
incorporated.

Currently, I am working on building my own blog about software engineering
and development.
Sharing my knowledge and experience in the industry is important to me,
as it allows me to give back to the community and help others succeed.

## “Show, don’t tell”
"Show, don't tell" is a writing technique that emphasizes the importance of
using specific details and examples to illustrate a point rather than
simply stating it. In the context of job interviews, this means providing
specific and memorable details about yourself and your experiences to help
you stand out to potential employers, rather than simply stating generic
statements about your skills or interests. By sharing personal stories and
specific examples, you can demonstrate your authenticity and passion, and
make a stronger impression on your interviewer.

### “Show, don’t tell” explanation
**Sprinkle in specific details**
Imagine two responses to the stock
interview question “Tell me about yourself.”

First: I started programming
about two years ago with some personal projects. I eventually got a job at
a small tech company in my home town, and I’ve been working there about a
year and a half. I like my job, but I’m looking for a new challenge, which
I think your company could provide.

Then: I got started programming because
I wanted to build a social network for cats. That didn’t take off, but the
prototype helped me get a job at a small tech company in my home town. Last
month, I read an awesome article on Hacker News about the social network
your company is building. The scaling challenges you face seem like they’ll
help me grow faster and stronger than my current role will.

The second response says a lot more about the candidate. Why? Because of the specific
details. An interviewer won’t remember the tenth person to say “I’m looking
for a new challenge.” They will remember the person who tried to build a
social network for cats and read about their company on Hacker News. So
don’t skimp on the details. Look out for opportunities to use specifics,
especially if they’re at all quirky, funny, surprising, or otherwise
memorable.

**Tell a story from your life**
Take another common question: “Why do you
want to work here?”
People tend to just cross-reference their values with those of the company or team they’re interviewing with: I’m really
interested in technical blogging and open source. So I like that your
company has some open-source work and contributes back to the community.

That’s a fine response. But to really wow your interviewer, try adding a
specific story around those values:
A couple years ago, when I was still new to programming, I was working on this tricky bug. I found a post on a company blog where an engineer explained how her team solved the issue. She
included a code snippet she’d open-sourced. I appreciated that she took the
time to write about her team’s experience and share their solution. It
helped me! That’s how I first started getting into open source. I really
wanna work with more engineers like that—who write about their work and try
to help others in the community.
So I was excited to see all the stuff your
team shares on your blog and on the company’s Github profile.

The second response just sounds more genuine. It shows a personal connection to open
source and technical blogging, instead of just telling it.
Anyone can look up a company’s core values and repeat them during an interview. It’s more
meaningful to tell a story from your life that shows how those values
benefited you or taught you something.

### STARS Technique
Situation:
Describe the situation that you were in when you needed to accomplish. It can be from your
current job, previous job or from any relevant experience such as volunteer work or college clubs

Task:
What goal were you working toward? Describe the challenge and what needs to be done to
get a positive output?

Action:
Elaborate the measures you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail.
Describe the precise
steps you took and the contribution. Talk about yourself rather than the team

Result:
Describe the outcome of your actions in a quantifiable way. Communicate multiple positive results

If the answers have a negative outcome, they should highlight your resilience or adaptability.

### Use someone else’s voice
This one’s a neat trick. Consider one more standard behavioral question: “What’s your biggest strength?”

You might tell the interviewer:
I work well with others. Even under tough circumstances, I make sure my coworkers feel supported.

But a lightly detailed story is better suited to show this strength:
I have a coworker, Ana, who’s been an engineer for almost a decade.
We worked together on this really tough, messy project.
Towards the end, she told me, “For such a hellish project, you really made things feel sane.”
I think this is my biggest strength—I work well with others, even under tough circumstances.
When you respond with a story, you can refer to what other people have said about your best qualities.

In this case, a ten-year tech veteran said you made a project feel less awful.
That kind of praise is a lot more credible when it comes from someone else.

Practice, practice, practice
Remember these specific tricks for showing rather than telling:
Use specific, memorable details. “Social network for cats” instead of “a personal project.”
Tell a story from your life. “I was trying to solve a tricky bug…” instead of
“I value open source contributions.”
Use someone else’s voice. “’You really made things feel sane‘” instead of "I work well with others."
Try these tactics out on the questions below. Keep in mind, sometimes it’s easiest to start
with a “tell” response, then spruce it up to “show.”
Tell me your biggest weakness as an engineer.
Describe a tricky bug you’ve encountered.
What’s the biggest project you’ve shipped?
What’s your favorite programming language? Why?
How do you overcome interpersonal conflicts with coworkers?


# Personal Introduction

## How to answer "tell me about yourself":::
brief introduction:
Highlight your relevant experiences and skills:
Talk about your work history, education, and any other relevant experiences
or skills you have that are relevant to the position or setting you're in.
Be sure to focus on achievements and results, rather than just listing responsibilities.
Show your personality and interests:
Share some information about your hobbies, interests, or passions.
This can help to humanize you and make you more relatable.
Tie it back to the present:
Finish your response by **summarizing** your current situation and goals, and how they relate
to the position or setting you're in.

Here's an example response:
"Sure, my name is Jane and I'm originally from Seattle. I'm currently working as a marketing manager at XYZ Company,

Here are some of the things I read online multiple times whilst building my resume but didn't know of the
impact they can really make.
Note:
I am a final year CS student [as of april 2021] and all of the following things are mere observations.
Observations sustaining the fact that I applied to 50 different companies and started to hear back only after
modifying my resume according to these techniques.
and that these techniques got me through without referrals!
Implied Things
All of the points mentioned below are something to be taken care of after the implied points like,
Clean and concise resume structure.
Consistent and readable font-style.
Highlight where necessary to emphasize.
Proper date formats.
Link everything. Everything!
Add links to your profiles on other platforms. (Github, Linkedin, Leetcode etc)
and any more...
ATS Friendly
Whether we like it or not, our resume will be scanned by a bot first. So we have to make sure our resume is readable - by a bot!.
There are tons of websites available online that will scan and analyze your resume. Use them.
However, sometimes these websites tend to make suggestions you'd absolutely hate to use in your resume. At that point,
go with your instinct. You have to make the resume ATS friendly, not anti-self.
Look for the ease with which the ATS will be able to segregate your skills, projects, job titles, internships and then
aggregate them under appropriate labels.
Metrics DO Matter.
I read articles online that asserted on the fact that one should build a data driven resume. All of the activities you
mention must have a number attached to them.
Data driven resume can directly point to the impact your effort/role created without relying on the recruiter/interviewer
to imagine the circumstances.
In order to explain this useful technique, most of the articles online give you the following example:
"...for example, write something like - 'By using X algorithms with Y technique, reduced Z by 50%' "
However if you are somebody like me, this example will baffle you. BAFFLE!
So my suggestion here is to focus on small things. As a student I focused on:
Number of active users on my website.
Size of the team I managed during a university event.
Number of students who attended my lecture series.
Number of participants in the virtual event I was invited to as a speaker. etc.
These are the things that matter to us at the current stage (student) and I suppose we should feel free to mention them.
Format Of The Resume File
Apparently, it's easier for the ATS if your file format is .doc, .docx instead of a pdf. So try and test this one online!

Start with a strong summary or objective statement that highlights your
experience, skills, and achievements. This statement should clearly
communicate your value proposition to the company.

Focus on your technical skills and experience. Be specific about the
programming languages, frameworks, and tools you have worked with.
Highlight your experience in building complex software systems, solving
technical problems, and delivering results.

Emphasize your experience working with large-scale distributed systems,
cloud computing, data analytics, and machine learning. These are

Provide details of your experience working on high-impact projects that
have contributed to the success of your previous employers. Highlight
your contributions to the development and deployment of software
systems, including your role in architecture, design, coding, testing,
and deployment.

Showcase your leadership skills and experience in managing teams of
developers, designers, and other technical professionals. Highlight your
ability to motivate, mentor, and guide team members towards achieving
project goals.

Demonstrate your passion for technology by listing any open-source
contributions, hackathons, or side projects you have worked on.

Include any relevant certifications or training courses you have
completed. This can demonstrate your commitment to staying up-to-date
with the latest technologies and best practices.

Use industry-specific keywords and phrases that the hiring manager may
be looking for in a FAANG candidate.

Keep your CV concise and easy to read. Avoid using jargon and technical
terms that may be unfamiliar to non-technical recruiters.
